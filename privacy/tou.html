XV. Arbitration
YOU AND COMPANY AGREE THAT THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE FORUM AND REMEDY FOR ANY AND ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS RELATING IN ANY WAY TO OR ARISING OUT OF THESE SITE TERMS, THE SITES AND/OR DOCWHERE (INCLUDING YOUR VISIT TO OR USE OF THE SITES AND/OR DOCWHERE) SHALL BE FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION, except that, to the extent that either of us has in any manner infringed upon or violated or threatened to infringe upon or violate the other party's patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret rights, such other party may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief.

Arbitration under this Agreement shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA")  under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and, in the case of consumer disputes, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ( the "AAA Consumer Rules") (collectively the "AAA Rules"). The location of the arbitration and the allocation of costs and fees for such arbitration shall be determined in accordance with such AAA Rules and shall be subject to the limitations provided for in the AAA Consumer Rules (for consumer disputes). If such costs are determined to be excessive in a consumer dispute, the Company will be responsible for paying all arbitration fees and arbitrator compensation in excess of what is deemed reasonable. The arbitrator's award shall be binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, NO ARBITRATION OR CLAIM UNDER THESE TERMS OF USE SHALL BE JOINED TO ANY OTHER ARBITRATION OR CLAIM, INCLUDING ANY ARBITRATION OR CLAIM INVOLVING ANY OTHER CURRENT OR FORMER USER OF DOCWHERE, AND NO CLASS ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS SHALL BE PERMITTED. In no event shall any claim, action or proceeding by you related in any way to the Sites and/or DocWhere (including your visit to or use of the Sites and/or DocWhere) be instituted more than three (3) year after the cause of action arose.
XVI. Indemnity
You agree to indemnify and hold the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates, and each of their directors, officers, agents, contractors, partners and employees, harmless from and against any loss, liability, claim, demand, damages, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, arising out of or in connection with any User Content, any Third Party Content you post or share on or through the Sites (including without limitation through the Share Service), your use of DocWhere or the Sites, your conduct in connection with DocWhere or the Sites or with other Users of DocWhere or the Sites, or any violation of this Agreement or of any law or the rights of any third party.

XVII. Submissions
You acknowledge and agree that any questions, comments, suggestions, ideas, feedback or other information about the Sites or DocWhere ("Submissions"), provided by you to Company are non-confidential and shall become the sole property of Company. Company shall own exclusive rights, including all intellectual property rights, and shall be entitled to the unrestricted use and dissemination of these Submissions for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, without acknowledgment or compensation to you.
XVIII. Other
These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and Company regarding the use of the Sites and/or DocWhere, superseding any prior agreements between you and Company relating to your use of the Sites or DocWhere. The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision in that or any other instance. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. If any provision of these Sites Terms shall be deemed unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

Warning: Always call 911 in the case of emergency. Always call the hospital to confirm its location, hours of operation and services before heading to the hospital.

Wait times may not always be accurate. The DocWhere app displays calculated wait times based on times entered by other users of the app.  You should always use your own best judgement when selecting an emergency room to visit.  All users are ultimately responsible for the medical facility that they choose.
